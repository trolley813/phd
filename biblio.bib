  abstract   = {Text retrieval systems have historically been refined through experimentation on test collections. In 1990 NIST was asked to build a very large test collection for use in evaluation of text retrieval technology in the DARPA TIPSTER project. This collection was to be on the order of 1 million full-text documents: a magnitude about 100 times larger than any existing non-proprietary test collection. The following year NIST proposed that this collection be made available to the full research community by the formation of the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC). The first conference took place in September, 1992 with 25 participating groups including most of the leading text retrieval research groups. Although scaling their research algorithms to handle this near-operational amount of text (for 1992) was a Herculean task, groups joined TREC to get the test data and to take part in the first major cross-system search engine evaluation. Participation in TREC has since increased each year. The most recent TREC (TREC-8 held in November, 1999) had 66 participating groups representing 16 different countries.This paper serves as a general introduction to TREC. Detailed information about TREC including the complete Proceedings for each workshop, instructions for obtaining test collections, and the Call for Participation for TREC-9 can be found on the TREC web site at http://trec.nist.gov. Task descriptions for some of the tasks to be done in TREC-9 follow in this issue. To participate in TREC-9, follow the instructions given in the Call for Participation.},

  abstract  = {This paper will focus on the semantic representation of verbs in computer systems and its impact on lexical selection problems in machine translation (MT). Two groups of English and Chinese verbs are examined to show that lexical selection must be based on interpretation of the sentences as well as selection restrictions placed on the verb arguments. A novel representation scheme is suggested, and is compared to representations with selection restrictions used in transfer-based MT. We see our approach as closely aligned with knowledge-based MT approaches (KBMT), and as a separate component that could be incorporated into existing systems. Examples and experimental results will show that, using this scheme, inexact matches can achieve correct lexical selection.},

  abstract   = {The Probabilistic Relevance Framework (PRF) is a formal framework for document retrieval,
grounded in work done in the 1970—1980s, which led to the development of one of the
most successful text-retrieval algorithms, BM25. In recent years, research in the
PRF has yielded new retrieval models capable of taking into account document meta-data
(especially structure and link-graph information). Again, this has led to one of the
most successful Web-search and corporate-search algorithms, BM25F. This work presents
the PRF from a conceptual point of view, describing the probabilistic modelling assumptions
behind the framework and the different ranking algorithms that result from its application:
the binary independence model, relevance feedback models, BM25 and BM25F. It also
discusses the relation between the PRF and other statistical models for IR, and covers
some related topics, such as the use of non-textual features, and parameter optimisation
for models with free parameters.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we reveal a common deficiency of the current retrieval models: the
component of term frequency (TF) normalization by document length is not lower-bounded
properly; as a result, very long documents tend to be overly penalized. In order to
analytically diagnose this problem, we propose two desirable formal constraints to
capture the heuristic of lower-bounding TF, and use constraint analysis to examine
several representative retrieval functions. Analysis results show that all these retrieval
functions can only satisfy the constraints for a certain range of parameter values
and/or for a particular set of query terms. Empirical results further show that the
retrieval performance tends to be poor when the parameter is out of the range or the
query term is not in the particular set. To solve this common problem, we propose
a general and efficient method to introduce a sufficiently large lower bound for TF
normalization which can be shown analytically to fix or alleviate the problem. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, incurring almost no additional
computational cost, can be applied to state-of-the-art retrieval functions, such as
Okapi BM25, language models, and the divergence from randomness approach, to significantly
improve the average precision, especially for verbose queries.},
